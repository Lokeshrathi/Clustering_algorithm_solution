# Clustering_salaries

Under this repo, I have worked on a clustering problem using KMeans clustering algorithm.

The dataset consists of 2 columns 
1. age
2. salary

Task: To analyse and understand the customer segments that might exist and identify the key attributes of each segment.

Result:
Data was divided into 3 segments and inferences were made accordingly.
